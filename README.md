Node.JS Weather App

Devloped using NODE.JS, The Weather API is developed using NODE.JS - taking into use depedencies including Express, Joi, 
Request among others. It also puts into use the HBS Templating Engine to render the HTML pages.

It integrates with two APIs to fetch real-time data of current weather conditions across the globe. 

These APIs are namely:

1. Dark Sky API:
   The Dark Sky API offers a full collection of meteorological conditions in 39 different languages. 
   The API allows you to look up the weather anywhere on the globe, returning where available ->
   - Current weather conditions
   - Minute-by-minute forecasts out to one hour
   - Hour-by-hour and day-by-day forecasts out to seven days
   - Hour-by-hour and day-by-day observations going back decades
   
2. MapBox Geocoding API:
   The Mapbox Geocoding API does two things: forward geocoding and reverse geocoding.
    - Forward geocoding converts location text into geographic coordinates
    - Reverse geocoding on the other hand turns geographic coordinates into place names.
